                    <h3>How the Roleplay Cafe came to be</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2014, the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, one of the most popular roleplaying game,
                        was released. At the same time a group of voice actors and friends were streaming their home
                        game on Twitch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The combination of these two things created a perfect storm: Dungeons and Dragons
                        became popular once more, and with it other tabletop roleplaying games as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many more people wanted to learn about roleplaying games and join the community, but it can seem
                        quite daunting.
                        Questions such as: which roleplaying game should I play, do I really need to read all those
                        books, do I need to put on a voice, do I really need all those minis are very common.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is why, in 2020 (the year of two Natural Twenties!), the Roleplay Cafe was opened: to serve
                        as a homebase for a growing community of roleplayers, a place for comraderie and for
                        bringing new people into the hobby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Roleplay Cafe takes care of all the logistics: a lace to play, food and drinks, minis and
                        terrain, even beamers and sound systems. All you
                        have to worry about is playing the game!

                    <h3>Richard, Roleplay Cafe owner</h3>
                    <p>
                        Richard learned about roleplaying games while still in high school, when the current edition
                        of Dungeons and Dragons was 3.5. He briefly tried to get a game going, but couldn't find the
                        right people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At university he discovered the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, and both played
                        and gamemastered with gusto.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was with the release of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and the
                        subsequent explosion that Richard decided to do more with roleplaying games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He quickly realized that what people needed was a homebase, a community where they could get to
                        know like-minded
                        people and not have to worry about things like paying for minis, arranging for food and drinks,
                        or even
                        having a space for playing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So together with his wife, he started the Roleplay Cafe, with the aim of turning it into a hub
                        for roleplayers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Liz, Roleplay Cafe owner</h3>
                    <p>
                        Liz had always had nerdy interests - video games, anime, comics - and also an interest in
                        hospitality: interacting with customers, making them feel at home, giving them advice about
                        food and drinks.

                    <p>
                        Her husband, Richard, introducted her to roleplaying games, and she has been playing
                        them for years now. She still has fond memories of her first Paranoia game and getting into
                        playfights with her fellow players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She actually came up with the idea of the Roleplay Cafe,
                        combining her husband's interest in roleplaying games with her own love of work in the
                        hospitality sector.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She is the face of Roleplay Cafe, making sure that players and gamemasters are satisfied with
                        their experience gaming at the cafe.
