                        <h3>How the Roleplay Cafe came to be</h3>
                        <p>In 2014, the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, one of the most popular roleplaying game,
                            was
                            released. At the same time a group of voice actors and friends were streaming their home
                            game on
                            Twitch. The combination of these two things created a perfect storm: Dungeons and Dragons
                            became
                            popular once more, and with it other tabletop roleplaying games as well. Many more people
                            wanted
                            to learn about roleplaying games and join the community, but it can seem quite daunting.
                            Questions such as: which roleplaying game should I play, do I really need to read all those
                            books, do I need to put on a voice, do I really need all those minis are very common. This
                            is why, in 2020 (the year of two Natural Twenties!), the Roleplay Cafe was opened: to serve
                            as a homebase for a growing community of roleplayers, a place for comraderie and for
                            bringing new people into the hobby. The Roleplay Cafe takes care of all the logistics: a
                            place to play, food and drinks, minis and terrain, even beamers and sound systems. All you
                            have to worry about is playing the game!</p>

                    <h3>Richard, Roleplay Cafe owner</h3>
                    <p>Richard learned about roleplaying games while still in high school, when the current edition
                        of
                        Dungeons and Dragons was 3.5. He briefly tried to get a game going, but couldn't find the
                        right
                        people. At university he discovered the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game, and both played
                        and
                        gamemastered with gusto. It was with the release of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and the
                        subsequent explosion that Richard decided to do more with roleplaying games. He quickly
                        realized
                        that what people needed was a homebase, a community where they could get to know like-minded
                        people and not have to worry about things like paying for minis, arranging for food and
                        drinks,
                        or even having a space for playing. So together with his wife, he started the Roleplay Cafe,
                        with the aim of turning into a hub for roleplayers.</p>

                    <h3>Liz, Roleplay Cafe owner</h3>
                    <p>Liz had always had nerdy interests - video games, anime, comics - and also an interest in
                        hospitality: interacting with customers, making them feel at home, giving them advice about
                        food
                        and drinks. She actually came up with the idea of the Roleplay Cafe, combining her husband's
                        interest in roleplaying games with her own love of work in the hospitality sector. She is
                        the
                        face of Roleplay Cafe, making sure that players and gamemasters are satisfied with their
                        experience gaming at the cafe.</p>
